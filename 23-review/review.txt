Review of SuperDuperDoku

Sudoku.java:17-39: the two get methods can be simplified by factoring out a general method for both

Sudoku.java:49: setting x equal to a.get(0) is extraneous, can just set x to a.remove(0) because remove returns the removed element

Sudoku.java:199-207: What is the difference between submit and checker? Both return a boolean based on whether userboard equals board. 
When checking for equality between 2d-arrays, you can use Arrays.deepEquals(Object[] a1, Oject[] a2), submit would not work because == cannot check for deep equality
